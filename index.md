## 🦾 Featured Robotics & HRI Projects

<!-- PROJECT 1 -->
### 🦑 Cuttlefish-Inspired Swimming Robot

<img src="assets/img/cuttlefish.png" alt="Cuttlefish robot simulation" width="100%">

**Goal:** Design and analyze a 9-link bio-inspired swimmer with undulatory motion.

- Built kinematic model of a 30 cm, 9-link soft body with variable amplitude.
- Estimated Reynolds number (~5×10<sup>4</sup>) and studied thrust generation.
- Tools: MATLAB / Python, basic CFD assumptions, robotics kinematics.

<!-- PROJECT 4 -->
### ✋ Gesture Recognition for Social HRI

<img src="assets/img/gesture_recognition.png" alt="Gesture recognition project" width="100%">

**Goal:** Recognize human gestures for more natural social interaction.

- Implemented a basic pipeline for detecting and classifying gestures.
- Used classical computer vision / or pre-trained pose models (e.g. MediaPipe / OpenPose).
- Evaluated accuracy on a small dataset of gestures.

- Tools: Python, OpenCV, Machine Learning basics.

## 👤 About Me

I am a Master's student in Robotics with a strong interest in **Human–Robot Interaction (HRI)**, especially how humans perceive and interact with robots in **embodied** and **immersive** settings (VR/AR).

Right now, I am looking for:

- 💡 MSc thesis opportunities in **HRI / Robotics / VR for robotics**  
- 🔬 Junior research or engineering roles in labs/companies working on HRI, teleoperation, or social robots.

If my profile matches what you're working on, I’d love to talk!
